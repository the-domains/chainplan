# we are BIG on exception management

As you are aware, your supply chain may have many interdependent stages, which need to seamlessly activate to keep things on track. But managing thousands of thousands of orders means relying on suppliers and their processes.

Spotting blockages in a supply chain as complicated as this is no easy matter for conventional systems. Potential issues may include:

* Order quantity  does not match supplier booked quantity,
* Outstanding order due for booking, due arrival date in jeopardy
* Palletised products not been fumigated
* Sewing labels are not complete
* Packaging has not been approved
* Red/Gold seal has not been received
* Container will incur demurrage in x number of days
