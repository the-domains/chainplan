## Constantly adding value..

Our award winning, omni-channel, stationary retail customer had a supply chain process which worked well but did not have the necessary visibility to make informed decision making at key milestones in the supply chain process.

They tendered separately for the freight management services and the visibility system.

Ligentix by Chainplan was selected as the preferred solution for their requirements.

A core instance of Ligentix was tailored specifically for their supply chain requirements providing inheritance of the purchase order from their ERP, SAP.

These orders are then distributed to vendors and agents via the online portal saving significant amounts on expensive value-added networks (VANS) and postage materials.

Suppliers are notified by email that new or amended orders are awaiting their approval and comments. The purchase order available online is identical to the SAP printed purchase order.

Any challenges to the order can be dealt with through the system with the earliest opportunity to engage buyers and merchandisers.

Manufacturing milestones are completed online against a critical path and at time of booking, detailed client based decision making logic has been built in to automatically approve a booking based upon a number of factors, all variable based upon region or product type. The supplier can create packing lists and commercial invoices online, so documentation can be available up to 7 days prior to ETD as opposed to up to 5 days post ATD.

Full exception management is provided through the dashboard pointing out either milestones that may be jeopardised or inaccuracies in SAP or 3PL data files.

Further business logic, which takes into account location of the 3PL CFS facilities, determines whether a booked order should be shipped on a 20GP or sent for consolidation.

A consolidation heat map will provide visibility of loose CBM cargo in any given region affording unparalleled opportunity to consolidate freight and improve container utilisation.

Complex data flows between SAP and the 3PL freight management system, GT Nexus, are stable and robust and reduce huge amounts of data entry.

Opportunities to provide to automate customs clearance based upon electronic commercial invoice data, which further reduces costs, and supply chain lead-time.

Further integration will include optimisation of the landside cartage process and full visibility of stock and transport movements online via the portal.

Further to this, regular workshops and calls with key members of the Chainplan and client SCM teams ensure that priorities are dealt with and new innovations are constantly adding value by removing manual tasks, reducing lead-time or improving accuracy, not least to provide visibility and opportunity to remove costs from the supply chain.

Ligentix was nominated in May 2014 and went live with first bookings in July 2014\. The speed of implementation is a unique factor of Ligentix.

The implementation process included the following tasks:

* Recognition of being supply chain partners with the client
* The portal was rebranded to engage all the clients staff as opposed to using 'another forwarders tracking system'
* Chainplan managed the vendor conferences on behalf of the client, performed training of the product to several hundred vendors across China in regional dialects.
* The Chainplan implementation team and trainers wore the clients corporate polo shirts for the events, demonstrating a true partnership and no mixed messages for the attendees
* Provided training videos and documentation to all suppliers in local languages
* Have a manned helpdesk to deal with queries from vendors, agents and indeed the clients staff
* We provide weekly calls to manage priorities, have high level management calls on a weekly basis and supply chain reviews, onsite in Melbourne quarterly and bi-annually in Hong Kong

The implementation of Ligentix has allowed the client the opportunity to study their supply chain in detail. It has also afforded them the opportunity to restructure and setup a new division called supplier conformance.

Ligentix will look to provide further value added tools to the new department and the merchandiser teams, such as :

* Product Lifecycle Management
* Online Product RFQ process
* Landed Cost Modeling
* Vendor Ethical Compliance
* Supplier league tables
* Merchandiser league tables

Chainplan is the first port of call for any new supply chain initiatives that exploit the visibility of management information.

Every day, Chainplan provides value to its clients and will strive to reduce costs, remove rework and improve collaboration between all parties in the supply chain and to assist in developing opportunities for the client's private equity owner.
