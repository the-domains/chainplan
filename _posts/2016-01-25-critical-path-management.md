# critical path management

Critical Path management is often viewed as nothing more than dry spreadsheets, project management software and time consuming, laborious and complicated processes. With potentially thousands of orders and millions of products it is easy to be overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the supply chain process.

At Chainplan, our goal is to take the complexity out of your critical path management and ensure you have a tailored, rounded and more manageable solution. We can enable your business to:

* Track actual completion dates of important milestones.
* Alert relevant parties when critical events are due or past.
* Update realistic downstream dates based upon realistic and agreed lead times.

When you choose Chainplan our solution will heuristically generate key milestone dates based upon key dates in your order.  Once a delivery date is set we can:

* Inform factories when raw materials need to be ordered and/or received
* When production needs to start and finish
* When samples need to be sent and approved
* When booking of goods with your forwarder needs to happen
* Which vessel and particular voyage it needs to sail on
* Keep you updated with revised arrival dates
* Ensure your goods arrive on time and on budget

Contact us today if you would like to put your business on track to a pain free critical path management solution.
