## opportunity innovation optimisation  scm excellence

A plant and machinery manufacturer with a premium reputation had been sourcing parts domestically, leading to issues with quality, consistency and cost.

Using Ligentix the organisation was able to achieve a best-cost country model that enabled all Asia factories to centralise stock in the country of assembly.  This near-shoring model, where goods remain in vendor ownership until called off benefits the organisation's cash flow.

Ligentix facilitates the monitoring of inventory, enabling a system that directly supports the business' goals, feeding just-in-time production, giving the client absolute confidence that the goods they need to satisfy customer demand are only ever 2 days away.

Underpinned by smart technology, the client has a robust and resilient solution that facilitates better planning and in doing so optimises all aspects of freight and haulage.

With some wonderful examples of expert consulting, the team were able to provide advice on packaging new products differently in order to ship different products together, where the smaller, higher value products subsidised the larger, lower value products. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7a374280-b1ba-4cf4-8294-6d7fadd6debf.jpg)
