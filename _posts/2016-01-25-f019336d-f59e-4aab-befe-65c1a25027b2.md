# Product & Process Lifecycle Management

Invariably, product masters are confined to spreadsheets which are cumbersome, limited and difficult to maintain and update.

Other PLM solutions are expensive, complicated and rising consultancy costs make a return on investment uncertain.

Chainplans PPLM module, Liantix, is different. It will take your existing product masters from your ERP and instantly create:

* Additional columns and fields
* Product attributes
* Image placeholders and packaging for your products
* Detailed technical diagrams
* Colour swatches

You can customize your own branded item specification, inherit this into other systems or share the information with your factories.

The power of Liantix doesn't end there however. Your request for quotes (RFQ) process with your suppliers can also be seamlessly integrated:

* Manage and send invitations to tender online
* Collate the tenders
* Select your provider
* Raise a pro-forma purchase order
* Export the purchase order back to ERP via event driven XML
